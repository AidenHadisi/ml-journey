A structured repository documenting my journey through Machine Learning, featuring comprehensive code examples, detailed notes, and hands-on projects.

## ðŸ“š Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main sections:

### 1. Lessons (Files prefixed with `l`)
- Structured learning materials and implementations
- Format: `l{number}_{topic}.ipynb`
- Contains theory, code examples, and explanations

### 2. Projects (Files prefixed with `p`)
- End-to-end ML applications and experiments
- Format: `p{number}_{project_name}.ipynb`
- Real-world problem solving and implementations

### 3. Exercises (Files prefixed with `x`)
- Practice problems and coding challenges
- Format: `x{number}_{exercise_name}.ipynb`
- Hands-on coding exercises with solutions
