    "# Machine Learning Foundation Series: Intro to Linear Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear algebra is the study of solving systems of linear equations. In its simplest form, consider the equation\n",

    "$$\n",
    "2x + 5 = 25.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Subtracting 5 from both sides and dividing by 2 gives the unique solution $x = 10$. In contrast, if an equation contains any non‐linear terms (for example, $x^2$ or $\\sqrt{x}$), it falls outside the realm of linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "A system of linear equations can have:\n",
    "- A **unique solution** (intersecting lines),\n",
    "- **No solution** (parallel lines), or\n",
    "- **Infinitely many solutions** (coincident lines).\n",

    "### Example: The Sheriff and the Bank Robber\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a sheriff in a car traveling at 180 km/h (which is 3 km/min) chasing a bank robber in a car traveling at 150 km/h (2.5 km/min). The bank robber gets a 5‑minute head start. Setting the distance functions equal gives\n",

    "which, when solved, yields $T = 30$ minutes and a crossover distance of 75 km. This simple system illustrates the nature of linear equations: a single intersection point where the paths meet.\n",

    "## Tensors: The Data Structures of Linear Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors generalize the concepts of scalars, vectors, and matrices to any number of dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalars (0D Tensors):** Single numeric values.\n",
    "- **Vectors (1D Tensors):** Ordered arrays representing points or directions in space.\n",
    "- **Matrices (2D Tensors):** Rectangular arrays with rows and columns.\n",
    "- **Higher-Dimensional Tensors:** For example, a 4D tensor can represent a batch of images with dimensions corresponding to (batch size, height, width, channels).\n",
    "\n",
    "These data structures are created and manipulated using Python libraries:\n",
    "- **NumPy:** The foundation for array and matrix operations.\n",
    "- **TensorFlow:** Provides tensors along with automatic differentiation and production-level tools.\n",
    "- **PyTorch:** Known for its intuitive API and GPU acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical Python snippet for creating a vector with NumPy might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "x = np.array([25, 3])\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Vector Operations and Norms\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors not only indicate a point in space but also carry magnitude and direction. A common operation is **transposition**, which turns a row vector into a column vector (and vice versa). In notation, the transpose of vector $\\mathbf{x}$ is written as\n",
